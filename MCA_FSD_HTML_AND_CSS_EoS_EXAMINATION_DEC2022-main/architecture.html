                    <h2>Architecture and Design</h2><br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taj is constructed on the banks of River Yamuna and it is said that more than 22,000 workers were involved in the construction. Artisans and materials from all over India came for its construction. The Taj is a combination of Islamic, Persian, and Indian architecture. Other structures included in the Taj are garden, mosque, main gateway, and tomb.</p><br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was designed by Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, and is generally regarded as the best example of Mughal architecture, which is a blend of Indian, Persian and Islamic styles. The architectural principles the Taj Mahal encapsulates include: Rational and strict geometry. Perfect symmetrical planning.</p><br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ustad-Ahmad Lahori</b> was the main architect of the Taj Mahal. The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture.</p><br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of its special features which make it a masterpiece in marble are the gateway, the central dome, the elegant minarets, the lovely gardens and the intricate inlay work on marble. The arrangement inside is like that of the Humayun's tomb.</p><br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tajmahal is <b>unique</b> because of its symmetrical marble construction having the most aesthetic view from all sides.</p><br>
